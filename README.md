# Nmap Scan ‚Äì Internal Vulnerability Assessment (Home Lab)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Nmap to perform a basic vulnerability scan against a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine in a private lab environment. The goal was to identify open ports, running services, and potential attack surfaces in preparation for further enumeration and exploitation.

## Scan Command Used

bash nmap -sS -sV -0 -T4 192.168.56.101

-sS: SYN scan
-sV: Detect service versions 
-O: Attempt OS detection
-T4: Aggressive timing for quicker scans

## Analysis

The scan revealed multiple open services, including:

FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4) ‚Äì known for past vulnerabilities.

Apache HTTP (port 80) ‚Äì useful for web enumeration.

Samba/SMB (ports 139 & 445) ‚Äì can be tested using enum4linux.

MySQL (port 3306) ‚Äì typical for backend SQL enumeration.

The OS fingerprinting suggests a Linux-based system, likely Ubuntu.

These services provide entry points for tools like Nikto, Hydra, Dirb, and Metasploit in further stages of testing.

---

## Next Steps

Enumerate web directories with gobuster or dirb.

Run enum4linux for SMB enumeration.

Test weak credentials on FTP, SSH, and MySQL.

Map service versions to known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

---

## Skills Demonstrated

Network scanning with Nmap

Interpreting port, version, and OS fingerprinting results

Understanding common attack surfaces in vulnerable environments

Following ethical hacking best practices in isolated labs
